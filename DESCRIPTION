Description: 'RCaucTile' provides an R implementation of the East Caucasian Languages template, designed for generating tile maps for East Caucasian Languages in 'ggplot2' (see 'PyCaucTile' for the Python version). It draws inspiration from the Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan (TALD) <https://lingconlab.ru/tald>. The TALD project initially features three distinct map visualizations. This package extends this by introducing a new tile map visualization, which displays a rectangle for each language and allows for color-coding based on specific linguistic features.
