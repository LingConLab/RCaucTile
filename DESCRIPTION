Description: This package provides an R version of the East Caucasian Languages dataset and a tool for generating tile maps from it. The inspiration for this package is the Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan (TALD) <https://lingconlab.ru/tald>. Initially TALD features three different types of map visualizations. This package introduces a new visualization: a tile map that displays a  rectangle for each language, allowing for color-coding based on specific features.
