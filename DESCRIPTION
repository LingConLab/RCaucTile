Description: 'RCaucTile' generates tile maps for the East Caucasian language family, inspired by the Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan (TALD, <https://lingconlab.ru/tald>). It leverages 'ggplot2' to create visually informative maps, displaying rectangles for each language and allowing for color-coding based on linguistic features. The package includes a built-in dataset of 56 languages and the template for their distribution and provides flexibility to customize the tile map's appearance. The default template can be modified via the ability to hide or rename languages.  It's designed to be used with external data tables containing language information and features, offering a tool for visualizing the geographic distribution and linguistic characteristics of East Caucasian languages.
