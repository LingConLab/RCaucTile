# RCaucTile

[![Project Status: Active - The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)

`RCaucTile` provides an R implementation of the East Caucasian Languages template, designed for generating tile maps for East Caucasian Languages in `ggplot2` (see [`PyCaucTile`](https://github.com/LingConLab/PyCaucTile/) for the Python version). It draws inspiration from the Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan (TALD) <https://lingconlab.ru/tald>. The TALD project initially features three distinct map visualizations. This package extends this by introducing a new tile map visualization, which displays a rectangle for each language and allows for color-coding based on specific linguistic features.

I would like to thank Yura Koryakov, Kostya Filatov, Ira Politova and Vlada Termus for the help with preparing language template.
