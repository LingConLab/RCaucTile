`RCaucTile` provides an R implementation of the East Caucasian Languages template, designed for generating tile maps for East Caucasian Languages in `ggplot2` (see [`PyCaucTile`](https://github.com/LingConLab/PyCaucTile/) for the Python version). It draws inspiration from the Typological Atlas of the Languages of Daghestan ([TALD](https://lingconlab.ru/tald/)). The TALD project initially features three distinct map visualizations. This package extends this by introducing a new tile map visualization, which displays a rectangle for each language and allows for color-coding based on specific linguistic features. The detailed tutorial is available [here](https://lingconlab.github.io/RCaucTile/).

Here are several examples of the result tile maps.

I would like to thank Yura Koryakov, Kostya Filatov, Ira Politova and Vlada Termus for the help with preparing language template.
